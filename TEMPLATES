# Templates
This file is a collection of frequently used snippets throughout the project. It
is  intended  primarily to  reduce  the  friction to  working  on  a project  by
providing a central place to copy such idioms for.

For that reason all such templates might stay  in one file no matter how long it
is, partly  for search-ability, partly to  reduce the number of  open files that
not all editors are well optimized for  navigating between. If you do not have a
tool, or knowledge of a tool capable  of searching through text files easily you
should find one.

## Guidelines for Writing Templates
This file is not meant to be highly professional in any way, so guidelines are lax, the main important things are:
- Wrap your template in some kind of delimtier, like code blocks
- Wrap text meant to be replaced with some distinct delimiter, like `<>`
- Titles may be useful for searching
